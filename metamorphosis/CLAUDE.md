# METAMORPHOSIS

Governed evolutionary intelligence for Claude Code.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd metamorphosis
claude
/awaken "Build authentication system"
```

## What This Does

METAMORPHOSIS adds governance to evolutionary AI:

1. **The Council** - Multi-model judges (Claude + GPT + Gemini) + humans via Slack
2. **Pattern Plasmids** - Successful patterns spread between timelines
3. **Heritage Prompts** - Hybrids inherit wisdom, not raw code
4. **The Ledger** - Immutable record of all decisions
5. **Co-evolution** - The Council improves based on outcomes

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/awaken` | Start new evolution with context detection |
| `/evolve` | Advance all timelines one generation |
| `/status` | View ecosystem state |
| `/cross α β` | Crossover two timelines |
| `/council` | Manually invoke Council review |
| `/select` | Choose winner for production |
| `/ledger` | Query decision history |

## Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `flux-core` | Evolution engine with governance |
| `council` | Multi-model + human governance |
| `heritage-extractor` | Extract wisdom from elite parents |
| `ledger-keeper` | Record decisions immutably |

## Governance Tiers

- **Routine** (small changes): Junior Council auto-approves
- **Major** (new capability): Full Council + 1 human  
- **Critical** (security/production): Full Council + majority humans

## Safety Gene Requirements

Some trait combinations are toxic:

- `aggressive > 0.7` requires `defensive >= 0.4`
- `experimental > 0.6` requires `testing >= 0.4`
- `creative > 0.8` requires `methodical >= 0.3`
