      "rationale": "Electron provides the best balance of proven stability, rich native features (system tray, notifications, file dialogs), and maintainability for a Node/TypeScript team. While Tauri has superior bundle size, the Rust toolchain requirement and architectural complexity (Node sidecar) introduce unnecessary risk for a production migration tool. The 150MB bundle is acceptable for enterprise desktop utilities.",
      "concerns": "Monitor memory usage during large backup processing. Consider lazy-loading Electron modules. If bundle size becomes critical, revisit Tauri once the Rust/Node integration matures.",
