      "rationale": "Alpha (Modular Scripts) perfectly aligns with the established pattern and team priorities. The current 16→17 implementation is proven, maintainable, and understood. Adding odoo-17-to-18.ts as a parallel file follows the existing architecture exactly, requires zero new abstractions, and minimizes risk for production data handling. Both previous evolutions chose simplicity over sophistication—this should too.",
      "concerns": "Code duplication between version files is acceptable at this scale (2-3 versions). If the tool eventually supports 5+ versions, consider extracting common patterns into shared utilities (a gentle refactor, not a rewrite). The BETA config-driven approach becomes compelling only when managing 4+ version paths.",
