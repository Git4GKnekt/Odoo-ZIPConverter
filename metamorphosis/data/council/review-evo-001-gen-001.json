      "vote": "APPROVE_BETA",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Beta's simplicity (0.9) makes it ideal for initial deployment. The linear workflow reduces risk during critical data migration. However, recommend keeping Alpha patterns available for large backup scenarios.",
      "concerns": [
        "Beta's disk space requirements for large backups",
        "Should add streaming option for >10GB backups"
      ],

      "vote": "APPROVE_BETA",
      "confidence": 0.78,
      "reasoning": "Simple extraction approach is battle-tested. PostgreSQL handles the heavy lifting for migrations. Code is maintainable and debuggable.",

        "PostgreSQL dependency may limit deployment options",

      "reasoning": "Beta provides lowest barrier to entry. However, Gamma's Docker isolation is valuable for production reliability. Recommend Beta as default with Gamma as --isolated flag.",
      "concerns": [
        "Version compatibility without Docker pinning",
